we have arrary of    2 4 6 8 10 12 14     if we in the middle - #8 , easier to do..

public class BetterSort { 
	public static int betterSort( double [] a, double v) { 
	
	int lindex = 0; 
	int hindex = a.length; 
	int mIndex = (lIndex + hIndex+1) /2;
	
	do{
		if (a[mIndex]==v)return mIndex; 
		else if (v < a[mIndex]) { 
			hIndex = mIndex-1;
		else lIndex = mIdex+1;  //must be less than 
		} while (lIndex <= hIndex);
	
	}
}

public class User { 
	public static void main(String[] args) { 
	//todo auto generated method stub
	double aArray[] = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; 
	try { 
		int foundIndex = BetterSort.betterSort(aArray,5); 
		catch (ElementNotFoundException e) { 
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
		
		
		Sorting 
	-place data eements in some defined order
		>integers are natural 
		>Strings 		
	-Helps humans interpret and visualize information that can be inferred from the data elements
	-Helps computers detect patterns, isolate abnormal elements and classify individual elements actions usually include input, output or computation operations
	
	Why do we compare 
We look things in natural order   We can easily look and check value

	-bubble sort
	5 3 4 2 1 
	3 2 1 4 5  

	Insertion sort
	5 3 4 2 1
	3 4 5  <-- sorted  2 1  
	then 
	1 2 3 4 5 1 
	then 
	1 2 3 4 5 

	These two sorting have simular effectiveness

	how c differ to java  - machine language
	machine language differ to language 
		only works for particular machine
	types of architecture is diff in diff operating systems,  Platform  and jbm  - these are advantage of java
	
	Another ad  classes is loaded, verified, btye code is system modify, security checks your program 
	jbm prevent certain things happening 
	Steps to execute java program
	
	
	values in parent are important
	
	UML class diagram 
	
	if you have reference, you can assign it and sub classes 
	
	chequing account - is a new account 
	
	
	Lastly we have abstract classes , these class cant be created but provide structure to children 
	interfaces
