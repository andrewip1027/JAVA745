/** Deliverables 
*a)Create class hierachy which can used to represent the system described. Use concepts discussed in class to reduce code duplication, accurately model the system's data and to ensure type safety (ensure invalid values cannot be stored) 
Design decisions will be a key component of your grade 


*b) Implement model in Java. Submit the set of source files generated

*c) Write an app using the class created below in an application class called SocialMediaArchive, which allows a user to create all type of post
    A single array must be used to store all post types. 
A user should be able to do at least the following: 
    -Generate any type post
    -set publishing state (in accordance with system rules. This will not be possible with all psot types)
    -register reactions ("like", "retweet" etc, depending on the post type)
    -print post messages and related data
    -print number of currently published posts. This information must be tracked at the class level
