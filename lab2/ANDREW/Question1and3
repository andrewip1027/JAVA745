(target heart rate calculator) While excercising, you can use a heart rate monitor to see that your heart rate stays within a safe range suggested by your trainers and doctors. According to the American Heart Association (AHA) (http://bit.ly/TargetHeartRates), the formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in years. Your target heart rate is a range thats 50 - 85% of your maximum heart rate. 

Create a class called Heart rate. The class attributes should include the person's first name, last name, and date of birth (consisting of separate attributes for the month, day and year of birth) Your class should have a constructor that receives this data as parameters.
For each attribute provide set and get methods. 

The class also should include a method that calculates and returns the person's age (in years), a method that calculates and returns the person's maximum heart rate and a method that calculates and returns the person's target heart rate

Write a java app that prompts for the persons information, instantiates an object of class Heart Rates and prints the information from the object - including the person's first name, last name and date of birth -- then calculates and prints the person's age in (years), maximum heart rate and target heart - rate range.
